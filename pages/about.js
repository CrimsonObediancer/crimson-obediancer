          Cloaked in shadows, bound by ancient rites, the Crimson Obediancer is neither ruler nor rebelâ€”
          but the line between the two.<br /><br />
          Born of silence and forged through submission, his power isn't declared... it's obeyed.
          His robe glows with the memory of devotion; his presence bends the will of those who kneel.
          Some say he's a myth. Others know he watches.<br /><br />
          This page is dedicated to his design, his story, and the forces that gave him shape.
